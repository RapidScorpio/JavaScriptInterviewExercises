/*so if given a limit of 100, output a ordered arry from 1 - 100. 
the for loop is given and is a reversal from 100 to 0
no internal functions like reverse or order may be used*/

//ideal here is short code as in use the counter in the for loop to count 100 - i and add to arr
//you could also use a while or any other DS
